The assingment I came up with involved the development of a game in C, in order to have the students exercise what they learned about control flow statements and data structures.<p>As C is no easy language and neither are the libraries for developing graphical applications wihth it, I took to myself the task of developing a library that facilitates the creation of games. The library is capable of drawing primitives, rendering static and animated sprites, rendering text, playing sounds and making all complex matrix transformations that OpenGL allows.<p>Most of those operations usually require pre-loading assets as to not waste the computer's resources, but since the library's main design goal was to be as simple as possible to use and learn, I've applied caching and memoization techniques to minimize boiler-plate code required when using <a href=https://github.com/syndelis/jogo.h>the library</a>.<p>The library is also <a href=https://syndelis.github.io/jogo.h>fully documented</a> using Doxygen and GitHub Actions for automatically deploying updated versions.</p><span class=job-entry-title-rule> <h2>Development of a low-level game engine with a Python interface, the Eel Engine</h2> <hr class=job-entry-rule> </span><div class=job-entry-date-role><span class=job-entry-role>MAR 2020 ‚Äî SEP 2022</span><span> <div>Personal Project</div> </span></div><p>The project aims to provide a more user-friendly, pythonic and powerful alternative to the popular but outdated PyGame library.
