}}

<p class="justify">
At Arionkoder, I was outstaffed to iSeatz, a software company in the loyalty program business. I was invited to continue the development of a new Rust microservice, using the Axum framework, as well as SQLx for compile-time checked queries and Insta for unit testing.

}}

<p class="justify">
At ZarpSystem, I was outstaffed to iClinic, a clinic management software company. I was responsible for developing new features to an existing software, which included Fullstack work with Python+Django (REST API) for the Backend and JavaScript+React for the Frontend.
</p>

<p class="justify">
The development team was guided with the agile approach Scrum, with ceremonies like Dailies and two-week Sprints.
</p>

<p class="justify">
The job also involved requirements gathering with the Product Owner, development of unit tests and CI/CDs. Local development was handled via Docker Containers.
</p>

<p class="justify">
Our team was challenged with decoupling some of the most critical components of the Monolithic system into new Microservices. That included handling user login across different products and replicating and synchronizing required data to ensure the product‚Äôs resilience.

After graduating in Computer Science, I was invited by a couple of professors to pursue a Master's degree. During this journey, I have:

- Been granted a scholarship by [FAPEMIG];
- Given a lecture about the Rust Language and its security features ([SECOMP 2022]). [Documents] and [Video];
- Enrolled into a professor's internship program, which saw me teaching classes and developing a C library for game development ([jogo.h]). More about the latter below;
- Given a 4 hour corse on the Rust Language for a class of 30 students ([SECOMP 2023]), teaching from the basics all the way to advanced features such as monomorphism and polymorphism. [Slides in Portuguese];
- Developed an open source software for developing, simulating, plotting and modifying Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), written fully in Rust, as part of my thesis ([Software] & [Article]);

During my time at the University, I have:
- Been granted several scolarships for student tutoring and research & development;
- Participated in study groups about Computer vision and Computational Modelling;
- Participated in lectures ([SECOMP 2019]) about Data Science, Game Development, Web Development;
- Studied Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Bio-Inspired Algorithms, Ranking and Sorting Methods, Optimization, Operational Systems, Computer Architecture, Robotics, Math & Statistics, [and many other courses];
- Enrolled into an internship which later led to a job at ZarpSystem;
