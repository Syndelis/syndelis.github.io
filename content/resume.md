After graduating in Computer Science, I was invited by a couple of professors to pursue a Master's degree. During this journey, I have:

- Been granted a scholarship by [FAPEMIG];
- Given a lecture about the Rust Language and its security features ([SECOMP 2022]). [Documents][rust-secomp-2022] and [Video][rust-secomp-2022-video];
- Enrolled into a professor's internship program, which saw me teaching classes and developing a C library for game development ([jogo.h]). More about the latter below;
- Given a 4 hour corse on the Rust Language for a class of 30 students ([SECOMP 2023]), teaching from the basics all the way to advanced features such as monomorphism and polymorphism. [Slides in Portuguese][rust-secomp-2023];
- Developed an open source software for developing, simulating, plotting and modifying Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), written fully in Rust, as part of my thesis ([Software][ode-designer-rs] & [Article][master-thesis]);

During my time at the University, I have:
- Been granted several scolarships for student tutoring and research & development;
- Participated in study groups about Computer vision and Computational Modelling;
- Participated in lectures ([SECOMP 2019]) about Data Science, Game Development, Web Development;
- Studied Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Bio-Inspired Algorithms, Ranking and Sorting Methods, Optimization, Operational Systems, Computer Architecture, Robotics, Math & Statistics, [and many other courses];
- Enrolled into an internship which later led to a job at ZarpSystem;

# PROJECTS

{{ job_entry(
    title="Development of scientific softwares for the construction and simulation of mathematical and computational models",

    time_windows=["JUL 2018 ‚Äî MAR 2021", "FEB 2022 ‚Äî DEC 2023"])
}}

During my graduation, I collaborated with a professor in the development of a software that allows researches to construct mathematical and computational models via an intuiditve GUI, simulate in-place, export the results and even generate equivalent Python code.

The [software for Cellular Automatas] is a Qt desktop application made with C, Pyhton and Cython. The project was funded by [FAPEMIG].

During my pursuit of a Master's degree, we've once again partnered to develop a [similar software][ode-designer-rs] that allows researchers to create and simulate ODEs, written entirely in Rust. The software ships with an ImGui-based interface featuring a node editor. It's capable of generating Python code to simulate equations, is localized in English and Portuguese and is extensible via Python code. Saving and loading data has been handled with Serde.

}}

During my professor's internship (as part of my Master's), I have been tasked with creating the freshmen students' last assignment. The assingment I came up with involved the development of a game in C, in order to have the students exercise what they learned about control flow statements and data structures.

As C is no easy language and neither are the libraries for developing graphical applications wihth it, I took to myself the task of developing a library that facilitates the creation of games. The library is capable of drawing primitives, rendering static and animated sprites, rendering text, playing sounds and making all complex matrix transformations that OpenGL allows.

Most of those operations usually require pre-loading assets as to not waste the computer's resources, but since the library's main design goal was to be as simple as possible to use and learn, I've applied caching and memoization techniques to minimize boiler-plate code required when using [the library][jogo.h].

The library is also [fully documented] using Doxygen and GitHub Actions for automatically deploying updated versions.

}}

The project aims to provide a more user-friendly, pythonic and powerful alternative to the popular but outdated PyGame library. As such, the [Eel Engine] is a modern-interfaced game engine for Python.

The engine is written in C, for performace, and interfaced to Python via the usaged of Cython.

I was tasked with developing a leaderboard system that can connect users from Steam to Discord.

Therefore, I developed a C++ dynamic library (.SO + .DLL) for the GameMaker Studio 2 game to utilize and communicate with an API server made in Express.js, using a MariaDB database to keep the user‚Äôs scores. There‚Äôs also a Python Discord bot that fetches the data in order to interact with users.

[Soulchild] is an upcoming Metroidvania platformer coming to Windows, MacOS and Linux on Steam developed in GameMaker Studio 2. I‚Äôve contributed towards development by making several libraries and also by porting it to Linux.

Ever since my first academic year until the very last I‚Äôve had scholarships for student tutoring. They‚Äôve arguably made me a better teacher, as well as a better learner
